This folder includes all LANDIS-II input files for the simulations run for Chapter 2, 
"More widespread and severe wildfires under climate change lead to dramatic declines in 
high-elevation species in the dry mixed conifer forests of the inland western U.S." of
the dissertation "Assessing the Effects of Climate Change and Fuel Treatments on Forest 
Dynamics and Wildfire in Dry Mixed-Conifer Forests of the Inland West: Linking Landscape 
and Social Perspectives" by Brooke A. Cassell (2018).

There are three climate scenerios: Historical, RCP_4.5 and RCP_8.5. For each scenario,
10 replicates were run. All climate data files used are included in this folder (e.g.,
GFDL-CM3_85, inmcm4_45, IPSL-CM5A-LR_84, etc.) The corresponding entry in the ClimateConfigFile.txt
file must be changed to reflect the desired climate input file.
